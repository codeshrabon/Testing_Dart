--> void main()
-> This MAIN() method is the head of the program and when we compile a program then at first it will find the main mathod and run it as the starting point 'main()'


--> White space and line break 
Dart do ignore all this white space, tabs and newline that apperas in the program 

--> Case sensetive 
Dart mainly case-sensetive 

--> Statement ends with semiclone ';'
Each line you write or statement it need to be end with semiclone';'

--> comment 
single line comment //

--> Dart data type 
1. Numbers (integer and Double )
2. Strings
3. Boolean (bool)
4. List & Map (List is an ordered group of objects & Map data type represent a set of values as key-value pairs 


Dart Variable 
var we use it as universal of  other variables (String, int, double) so we can use var instead of ther variable.... 

But there is another variable 'Dynamic'. this dynamic keyword and var keyword both are word same.. 

::::	var = dynamic	::::

:: var = final , const:: 

--> 'final' and 'const' these are use for constant data ... if you initiate a data using final or const then that won't be change later...

final name = "shrabon";
X name = "ahmed";	--> ERROR


--> it use 'var' keyword as "non-type-checking"
var name = "faysal";
var num = 39;

--> There is another keyword as we use them on JAVA 

String name = "Faysal";
int num = 30;



--> Dynamic keyword 
this is like var 
dynamic = 49;
dynamic = "Faysal";



--------


so we can use store variable data 
-> var 
var = "Faysal";
var = 20; 
-> instead var we use int  , String , Double 
int number1 = 40;
double number2 = 50.0;
String name = "Faysal";

-> instead var we use dynamic 
dybamic name = "Faysal";
dynamic number = 50;

-> instead var we use for constant data is 'final', 'const'
final fName = "Faysal";
finale number = 40;
const lName = "Ahmed";
const number1 = 41;

--> Now loop 

Deinite	-> for

		-> while
Indefinite	
		-> do.. while 



--------------------------------

print("String");

in print method everything inside act as 'String' ...

in dart... if we want some variable inside of the print method..

var  i = 10;
for(i ; i<30; i++){
print(i.toString + ". Faysal");
print("${i}. Faysal");

--> ${} is this method anything we give it will count as variable..

In loop as we all know that continue statement are use to skip the step.

1-10
if i want 3 not to print 
the my statement will be 
if i == 3
continue;

it will skip 3 then print till 10;


------------
In Java we used array  alog with List, arrayList many other to store data and 
In dart we use List mainly so there is no use of array type. 

There is two type of List 
1. Fix length List  (var myList = new List(5);) creating 'new List(5);' using length size as an object intergating it into a variable name myList...
2. Growable List --> here var myList = new List(); there is no limit you just assign it. 
-> var myList = new List();
-> myList[] = "name1";
-> myList[] = "name2";
-> ...

new use of List 
-->Fix length 
var nameList = new List.filled(length:10, '', growable:false/true);


and 

-> Growable List 
var nameList = <String>[];

//List<String> nameList = [];


nameList.add("Faysal");
nameList.add("Faysal");

---> There is some interseting thing in List inserting data 
-> List.add(); - for single data 
-> List.addAll(["name","name"]); - for multiple data using (["name","name"])
-> List.insert(index,"Name");
->List.insertAll(index, ["name", "name"]);

--> But in insert(index, element) method you need to specify the index number then the element you give...



------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Removing List items

list.remove("variables that i want to delete");

list.removeAt(index); usng it you can specifically delete the item you want..


-----------------------------
Updating the index

List<String> listName = [];
or 
var listName = <String>[];

listName.add("A");
listName.add("B");
listName.add("C");
listName.add("D");

listName.replaceRange(0,1, ["H"]);


List.replaceRange(start_index, end_Index, Replacement);

List.replaceRange(own index number which one to change, next indext number will be ending point, ["Replacemen]);



---------------DART Map ----------------------
in map all are the same concept 
But there is Key, Value concept is there 
var myMap = { 
"name": "Faysal",
"age" : "27",
"height" : "6 feet"
}
print (myMap);

// adding data in runtime 
  myMap ["school"] = "MBSC";

Creating map by Constructor::::

1. creating object 'new Map()"
2. assing to a variable "var newMap = new Map()"

using them in code 
var newMap = new Map();
newMap.add("Faysal);


Map<dynamic,dynamic> myMapCons= new Map();

  myMapCons ['name'] = "Shrabon";
  myMapCons ['age'] = "27";
  
  myMapCons ['height'] = "6 feet";
  myMapCons ['collage'] = "DIC";

// for (var myMapLoop in myMapCons) {
//   print(myMapLoop);
// }
  print(myMapCons.keys);
  print(myMapCons.values);
  //using .entries help you to get all the element you have entered it shows 
    print(myMapCons.entries);
  

  // use of .addAll, .clear, .remove("key")

  Map <dynamic,dynamic> newMapEx = new Map();
  // to enter mltiple or more then one data into the map
  newMapEx.addAll({"name":"Russell", "age":"49"});

  print("from new map expriment "+ newMapEx.toString());


## using addAll you can add multiple data 
## using clear it will delete all the data 
## and using remove this method will remove the exact data using 	the key 
, 

###############################################
Using dart Set 

'set' represents a collecton of objects can occur only once 
List and set are the same 
but in list we can keep duplicate values but in set we cant 

* Creating object of Set()
var mySet = new Set();

#if duplicate values are in Set they will be ignored whill compile..

var mySet = new Set();
mySet("300");
mySet("401");
mySet("402");

for (var mySets on mySet){
print(mySets);
}

using loop will give you a data in line which we want 

###using Hashmap() 

its similar to Map but 
in HashMap if you insert data into it 
then the serial wont be as same serial it can be change 
this is the difference ..
Using HashMap it will import a package import 'dart:collection';

var myHashMap = new HashMap();
myHashMap.add("values");
myHashMap.add("values");
myHashMap.add("values");

print(myHashMap);

other things are same as map 
myHashMap -->
.addAll
.remove
.clear
.key
.value



## HashSet() they are not as similar to HashMap()
HashMap are with key and values
but HashSet are to values

you have to add data by .add("values");

HashSet<dynamic> mySet = new HashSet();

mySet.add();
mySet.addAll();
mySet.remove();
mySet.clear();

 HashSet<dynamic> myHashSet = new HashSet(); 

   myHashSet.add("Faysal");
   myHashSet.add("29");
   myHashSet.add("MBSC");

   print(myHashSet);
   print("Using For each loop");
   for (var myHashSets in myHashSet) {
    
     print(myHashSets);
   }
   print("Uing remove method");
   myHashSet.remove("29");
   print(myHashSet);
   print("Length of this HashMap: ${myHashSet.length}");

-------------------------------------

### Generics

Till we learn 
1. List 
2. Map
3. Set
4. HashMap
5. HashSet

"All are the same as they do the main thing is to collect data...all them togather called as collection framework"
   ______________________________________________________________


## function 

function is mainly out side of the main function 
and you can call them any time 
** for function you do not need to create object

void main()
{
	 function1();
	print(function1);
}

void function1(){
	var name = "Faysal";
	print("this is function );

}

----------------------------------------------------------------

### class

out side main method 
class are just as we work with java 
using class_ and name_of_the_class

void main(){
	var classObject = new MyClass(); // you can use new not 								//mendatory in dart 

	var printNewClass = classObject.myMethod();
	print(printNewClass);
}


class MyClass{

	void myMethod(){
	print("Faysal");
}

method and function are same 
but the differences is method are in side class 



_________________________________________________________
Inheritance and overriging..........

Inheritance with override ---> by modifying the parent class method through child class method is method overriding...

using 
@override 
is to show that the method has beed overridden...




__________________________________
Abstract method --- inheritance


you cant create an object of abstract class

----------------------------------------

Super --- inheritance 

its mean that using super keywod you can grab something or some method or all the method of parent class in your own child class inside your another method 


*********method over ride *********

using a method which inside of a class or any where using it from other class using the same method name @override ing them by force or changing them 

child class have the privilage use of @super 
its makes him supireor then parent class




***** method over load *******
its similar with polymorphisom, 

over loading just like using same method name but changing its parameter and mostly changing the parameter 



____________________________________________________


****in dart we dont use method overloading***** 



but static we do use them 

In a good sence that inside a class if we create a method or any element or properties they got no relation with the class 

class Myclass{
	 
	void myName(){
	print(20+50);
		}


}

the method do not have any realation with the class 
cause in main method we cleate a object of the class then 
the object will interact with the method or the properties 

void main(){

var obj = new MyClass();
obj.myName();

}



but if we use static keyword with the method 

class Myclass{
	 
	static void myName(){
	print(20+50);
		}


}
then the method and class will be related and we do not need to create any object to intract with it.....


like 

void main(){

MyClass.myName();

}

_____________________________________

dart constructor 
* constructor vs normal method 
--> constructor does not have any return type 
like void class_name()
its simply the class_name();

simple function or simple method as you like 
* constructor calling 
--> no need to create for constructor an object 
while creating an object for class it autometically create object for constructor....
--> autometic called by creating object 
* pass data via constructor
