--> void main()
-> This MAIN() method is the head of the program and when we compile a program then at first it will find the main mathod and run it as the starting point 'main()'


--> White space and line break 
Dart do ignore all this white space, tabs and newline that apperas in the program 

--> Case sensetive 
Dart mainly case-sensetive 

--> Statement ends with semiclone ';'
Each line you write or statement it need to be end with semiclone';'

--> comment 
single line comment // 
mutiline comment /**/

--> Dart data type 
1. Numbers (integer and Double )
2. Strings
3. Boolean (bool)
4. List & Map (List is an ordered group of objects & Map data type represent a set of values as key-value pairs 


Dart Variable 
var we use it as universal of  other variables (String, int, double) so we can use var instead of ther variable.... 

But there is another variable 'Dynamic'. this dynamic keyword and var keyword both are word same.. 

::::	var = dynamic	::::

:: var = final , const:: 

--> 'final' and 'const' these are use for constant data ... if you initiate a data using final or const then that won't be change later...

final name = "shrabon";
X name = "ahmed";	--> ERROR


--> it use 'var' keyword as "non-type-checking"
var name = "faysal";
var num = 39;

--> There is another keyword as we use them on JAVA 

String name = "Faysal";
int num = 30;



--> Dynamic keyword 
this is like var 
dynamic = 49;
dynamic = "Faysal";



--------


so we can use store variable data 
-> var 
var = "Faysal";
var = 20; 
-> instead var we use int  , String , Double 
int number1 = 40;
double number2 = 50.0;
String name = "Faysal";

-> instead var we use dynamic 
dybamic name = "Faysal";
dynamic number = 50;

-> instead var we use for constant data is 'final', 'const'
final fName = "Faysal";
finale number = 40;
const lName = "Ahmed";
const number1 = 41;

--> Now loop 

Deinite	-> for

		-> while
Indefinite	
		-> do.. while 



--------------------------------

print("String");

in print method everything inside act as 'String' ...

in dart... if we want some variable inside of the print method..

var  i = 10;
for(i ; i<30; i++){
print(i.toString + ". Faysal");
print("${i}. Faysal");

--> ${} is this method anything we give it will count as variable..

In loop as we all know that continue statement are use to skip the step.

1-10
if i want 3 not to print 
the my statement will be 
if i == 3
continue;

it will skip 3 then print till 10;


------------
In Java we used array  alog with List, arrayList many other to store data and 
In dart we use List mainly so there is no use of array type. 

There is two type of List 
1. Fix length List  (var myList = new List(5);) creating 'new List(5);' using length size as an object intergating it into a variable name myList...
2. Growable List --> here var myList = new List(); there is no limit you just assign it. 
-> var myList = new List();
-> myList[] = "name1";
-> myList[] = "name2";
-> ...

new use of List 
-->Fix length 
var nameList = new List.filled(length:10, '', growable:false/true);


and 

-> Growable List 
var nameList = <String>[];

//List<String> nameList = [];


nameList.add("Faysal");
nameList.add("Faysal");


---> There is some interseting thing in List inserting data 
-> List.add(); - for single data 
-> List.addAll(["name","name"]); - for multiple data using (["name","name"])
-> List.insert();
->List.insertAll();
